            <h2>1. Easy workflow designer</h2>
            <h3><br>Creating workflows used to be the domain of hard-core system coders. So, as workflow<br>
                 software evolved, it assumed the people using it would be programmers as well.<br></h3>
                 <h3><br>However, a modern office automation system should start with the business user in mind,<br>
                      not the coder.</h3>
                      <h3><br>When you sit down to trial an office automation tool, start off by making your own workflows.<br>
                           How easy is it? Can you intuitively create the sequence of tasks needed to finish a process?<br>
                            If you can’t figure it out within the first five minutes, you need to move on to the next option.</h3>
                            <h3><br>A piece of software shouldn’t determine how your business should set its operations. It should instead aid your
                                 teams to strengthen the existing processes.</h3>

                <h2>2. Mobile compatibility</h2>
                <h3><br>Your office is mobile, and all your tools should be too. Whether you have remote workers or
                     you just want to check in while waiting for a flight, the office automation tool you choose
                      should work just as smoothly on someone’s phone while on a trip to China as it does on a PC
                       at the main office.</h3>
                       <h3><br>Your marketing campaign can’t be delayed a day just because you need to wait for Greg to get
                            back from his vacation in Machu Picchu.</h3>
                            <h3><br>You should be able to run your core processes from a secure cloud and never have to worry
                                 about where your data is or who is protecting it. If you use an office automation tool like Kissflow,
                                  then Greg can go over the marketing plan on his mobile from his hotel lobby in Peru and give his nod
                                   before he goes on to take selfies with the llamas.</h3>

                <h2>3. Integration with other software</h2>
                <h3><br>Office automation software isn’t the only thing you are running. You’ve got your internal database,
                     a CRM, a marketing automation tool, and your financial software, and that’s just for starters.
                      When you’re reliant on so many systems, you need a tool that doesn’t just keep to itself.</h3>
                      <h3><br>Of all the software out there, office automation should be the easiest to integrate
                         with your other tools. If it doesn’t, you are stuck pushing data around from one system
                          to another.</h3>
                          <h3><br>When doing an evaluation, see what kind of pre-integrations the office automation software
                             provides, or if it takes advantage of connecting to a tool like Zapier to open access to thousands
                              of other cloud tools.</h3>

                    <h3><br>How do you know if your office automation is yielding results? You can’t just evaluate process performance based
                         on how happy your team is. Data is the ultimate decision-maker, and it’s important for your business to compare a process’
                          history, its speed, the outcome quality, etc.</h3>
                          <h3><br>Adopting another software to measure your workflow data is time-consuming and unnecessary. Why not have a single piece
                             of software that comes embedded with reporting and analytics features? The best office automation products now come equipped
                              with this feature as part of their fundamental offering.</h3>

                         set to all of your business workflows.</h3>
                         <h3><br>A good workflow automation system understands this sensitive requirement and will have access control as part of its integral
